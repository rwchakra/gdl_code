Code for Graph Deep Learning Project, USI 2021

There are two separate folders for the QM9 and Synthetic dataset experiments respectively. The models folder contains the architectures for the EGNN and MPNN. The skeleton code used for writing the architectures was from [here](https://github.com/vgsatorras/egnn). The rest of the code was written independently.
